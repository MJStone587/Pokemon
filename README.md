# Pokemon
Site Preview: https://mjstone587.github.io/Pokemon/

Why? : 

  I built this small program to practice working with API and as a fan of Pokemon I was always frustrated using the Serebii site. I wanted a smaller more concise pokemon site that gave me the information I wanted without having to slog my way through numerous serebii pages. 

What did I use? : 

  I used a lot of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and of course the PokeAPI

Details:
 This site is not setup accurately for mobile and therefore I would not recommend using on mobile devices. It is something I will eventually come back to and adjust. As of now dedicating the time for that while continuing to learn and prepare for a junior development role is not the best use of my time.
