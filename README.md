# Pokemon
Why? : 
  I built this small program to practice working with API and as a fan of Pokemon I was always frustrated using the Serebii site. I wanted a smaller more concise pokemon site that gave me the information I wanted withought having to slog may way through serebii. 

What did I use? : 
  I used a lot of JavaScript, CSS, and some HTML.

What did I learn? :  
  Other than learning A LOT about using an api and handling the json data, I also learned a lot about scope and planning. It is so incredibly important to have a solid idea of the scope of the project. What features should be involved, how I want it displayed aka style - UI / UX, and a clear idea of who and why this program is being created for. I found that while building this project I thought of new features I wanted to add. When adding those features it was much much easier to create or run into bugs because I had not planned or built my code with those features in mind. Thankfully functions make most code essentially modular, but I could see how in a much larger projects this could become troublesome. There is no doubt that in bigger projects new features will be an inevitability. Knowing this the scalability and cleanliness of code is that much more important. This shed a light on my own code. I want my code to be cleaner, easier to read / understand, and more  "modular" so that it is easier to add new features and scale up. This is something I imagine will improve with more time and practice but I want it to become something I am conscious of.
